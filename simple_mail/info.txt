Simple way of using nrpe checks with mail.



Edit following lines:
---------------------

MAILSERVER      - your SMTP server (for gmail use: smtp.gmail.com)
MAILSERVER_PORT - your SMTP server port (for gmail use: 587)  
LOGIN           - your SMTP login (for gmail use xxxx without @gmail.com)
PASSWORD        - your SMTP password
FROM            - source mail address (for gmail use xxxxx@gmail.com)
RECIPIENTS      - destination mail address


script has two options:
-----------------------
--printonly   - run all checks and print results on the console (in html format) without sending anything. This is for debugging purposes.
--sendonly    - run all checks and send result to the RECIPIENTS without printing anything on the console
